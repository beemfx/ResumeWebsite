<h1>Code Samples</h1>
<p>
Most non-commerical code that I've written is available at various repositories
on the web. Emergence Tech and the game E.X.P.L.O.R., my best work yet, are not open source at
this time. Note that "Beem Software" and "Beem Media" are me, Blaine Myers, and not an actual
business entity.

<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>
My open source projects may be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/beemfx/">https://github.com/beemfx/</a>. 
This includes the full source code for ScrollGIN, a few other game 
projects I have developed, and almost all non-commercial code that I've written.

<h2>SourceForge</h2>
<p>
The source for CornerBin is available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cornerbin/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cornerbin/</a>.
