Written in C++ for MS Windows using MFC. This application eliminates the need to
have an icon for the Recycle Bin on the desktop. It places an icon in the system
tray that has similar functionality to the Recycle Bin. It features the ability
to customize certain settings in the application, such as the icon, and certain
behavior.

<?php BeginSection('Podcast Sync Prep', true, 3); ?>
<p>
This is a utility designed to prepare podcasts to be synchronized to a portable
music device. Many music devices offer the abilities to play audio files in
alphabetical order or by shuffling. It is often desirable to play podcasts in
a specific order. This utility features an easy to use drag and drop interface
that allows someone to specify the order that a set of podcasts should be played
and renames the files appropriately. Then when the files are copied to the
music device, they will play in the appropriate order. It also clears any MP3
tags that may have otherwise confused the device into playing the files in some
other order based on "Album" or "Genre", for example.
</p>
<p>
This application was written in Java using the Swing and AWT APIs for the
Windows interface.
